me to the place where you go\nWhere nobody knows if it's night or day\nPlease don't put your life in the hands\nOf a rock 'n' roll band\nWho'll throw it all away\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm gonna start a revolution from my bed\n'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head\nStep outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom\nStand up beside the fireplace\nTake that look from off your face\n'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd so, Sally can wait\nShe knows it's too late as she's walking on by\nMy soul slides away\nBut don't look back in anger, I heard you say\n\n[Guitar

worshipped her sooner\nIf the heavens ever did speak\nShe's the last true mouthpiece\nEvery Sunday's getting more bleak\nA fresh poison each week\n\"We were born sick\"\nYou heard them say it\nMy church offers no absolutes\nShe tells me \"Worship in the bedroom\"\nThe only Heaven I'll be sent to\nIs when I'm alone with you\nI was born sick, but I love it\nCommand me to be well\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAaa, Amen, Amen, Amen\n\n[Chorus]\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me that

something shiny\nSomething meaty for the main course\nThat's a fine looking high horse\nWhat you got in the stable?\nWe've a lot of starving faithful\nThat looks tasty\nThat looks plenty\nThis is hungry work\n\n[Chorus]\nTake me to church\nI'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies\nI'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife\nOffer me my deathless death\nGood God, let me give

comes the sun, doo da doo doo\nHere comes the sun, and I say\nIt's all right\n\n[Verse 1]\nLittle darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter\nLittle darling, it feels like years since it's been here\n\n[Chorus]\nHere comes the sun, doo da doo doo\nHere comes the sun, and I say\nIt's all right\n\n[Verse 2]\nLittle darling, the smile's returning to the faces\nLittle darling, it seems like years since it's been here\n\n[Chorus]\nHere comes the sun\nHere comes the sun, and I say\nIt's all right\n\n[Bridge]\nSun, sun, sun, here it comes\nSun, sun, sun, here it comes\nSun, sun, sun, here it comes\nSun, sun, sun, here it comes\nSun, sun, sun, here it comes\n\n[Verse 3]\nLittle darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting\nLittle darling, it seems like years since it's been clear\n\n[Chorus]\nHere comes the sun, doo da doo doo\nHere comes the sun, and I say\nIt's all right\n\n[Outro]\nHere comes the sun, doo da doo doo\nHere comes the sun\nIt's all right\nIt's all

1]\nI'm gonna fight 'em off\nA seven nation army couldn't hold me back\nThey're gonna rip it off\nTaking their time right behind my back\nAnd I'm talking to myself at night\nBecause I can't forget\nBack and forth through my mind\nBehind a cigarette\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nAnd the message coming from my eyes\nSays \"Leave it alone\"\n\n[Instrumental Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't want to hear about it\nEvery single one's got a story to tell\nEveryone knows about it\nFrom the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell\nAnd if I catch it coming back my way\nI'm gonna serve it to you\nAnd that ain't what you want to hear\nBut that's what I'll do\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nAnd the feeling coming from my bones\nSays \"Find a home\"\n\n[Instrumental Chorus]\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm going to Wichita\nFar from this opera forevermore\nI'm gonna work the straw\nMake the sweat drip out of every pore\nAnd I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding\nRight before the Lord\nAll the words are gonna bleed from me\nAnd I will sing no more\n\n[Pre-Chorus 3]\nAnd the stains coming from my blood\nTell me \"Go back home\"\n\n[Instrumental Chorus]"}]
